These are the operators that are used with the [[...]] construct. They can be logically combined with && ("and") and || ("or") and grouped with parenthesis. When used with filenames of the form /dev/fd/N, they test the corresponding attribute of open file descriptor N. docstore.mik.ua/orelly/unix3/korn/appb_05.htm

Operator 	True if... 
-a file 	file exists. (Obsolete. -e is preferred.) 
-b file 	file is a block device file. 
-c file 	file is a character device file. 
-C file 	file is a contiguous file. (Not for most Unix versions.) 
-d file 	file is a directory. 
-e file 	file exists. 
-f file 	file is a regular file. 
-g file 	file has its setgid bit set. 
-G file f	ile's group ID is the same as the effective group ID of the shell. 
-h file 	file is a symbolic link. 
-k file 	file has its sticky bit set. 
-l file 	file is a symbolic link. (Only works on systems where /bin/test -l tests for symbolic links.) 
-L file 	file is a symbolic link. 
-n string 	string is non-null. 
-o option 	option is set. 
-O file 	file is owned by the shell's effective user ID. 
-p file 	file is a pipe or named pipe (FIFO file). 
-r file 	file is readable. 
-s file 	file is not empty. 
-S file 	file is a socket. 
-t N 	File descriptor N points to a terminal. 
-u file 	file has its setuid bit set. 
-w file 	file is writable. 
-x file 	file is executable, or file is a directory that can be searched. 
-z string 	string is null. 
fileA -nt fileB 	fileA is newer than fileB, or fileB does not exist. 
fileA -ot fileB 	fileA is older than fileB, or fileB does not exist. 
fileA -ef fileB 	fileA and fileB point to the same file. 
string = pattern 	string matches pattern (which can contain wildcards). Obsolete; == is preferred. 
string == pattern 	string matches pattern (which can contain wildcards). 
string != pattern 	string does not match pattern. 
stringA < stringB 	stringA comes before stringB in dictionary order. 
stringA > stringB 	stringA comes after stringB in dictionary order. 
exprA -eq exprB 	Arithmetic expressions exprA and exprB are equal. 
exprA -ne exprB 	Arithmetic expressions exprA and exprB are not equal. 
exprA -lt exprB 	exprA is less than exprB. 
exprA -gt exprB 	exprA is greater than exprB. 
exprA -le exprB 	exprA is less than or equal to exprB. 
exprA -ge exprB 	exprA is greater than or equal to exprB. 

The operators -eq, -ne, -lt, -le, -gt, and -ge are considered obsolete in ksh93; the let command or ((...)) should be used instead. For =, ==, and !=, quote pattern to do literal string comparisons. docstore.mik.ua/orelly/unix3/korn/appb_05.htm
