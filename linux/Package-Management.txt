	? yumdownloader
	download RPM packages from yum repositories


	? RPM
		¡ð rpm -e <name>
		¡ð rpm -ivh <rpm-filename>

	The rpm command should not be used anymore for package installation
	It is still useful to work with the RPM database and allows you to do package queries
		¡ð rpm -qf /my/file will tell you which package a file is from
		¡ð rpm -ql mypackage queries the database to list package contents
	
	to query the package file instead of the package contents, add a p to the options
		¡ð rpm -qpc mypackage.rpm  lists configuration files in a downloaded package file
		¡ð rpm -qp --scripts mypackage.rpm  shows scrips that may be present in a package
