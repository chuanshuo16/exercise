PSFTP, the PuTTY SFTP client, is a tool for transferring files securely between computers using an SSH connection.

The usual way to start PSFTP is from a command prompt, much like PSCP.
set PATH=c:\path\to\putty\directory;%PATH%
psftp server.example.com
or
psftp fred@server.example.com

Alternatively, you can just type psftp or double-click the PSFTP icon, your will see the PSFTP prompt.
C:\psftp
psftp: no hostname specified: use "open host.name" to connect
psftp>
